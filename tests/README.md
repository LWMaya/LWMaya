Maya Test projects set up with linear workflow.

Included here are maya project folders per renderer with specific scene files for Maya versions 2014, 2015 and 2016.
There is a texture file in the projects.
In order to find the relative paths for the texture, users must first set the project path in Maya before opening a scene.
